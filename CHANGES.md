- Initial release.

# akar-core v2.0.0 / 2018.04.11

### Changed
- The project `akar` is now called `akar-core`. `akar` will henceforth refer to the umbrella project housing all the satellite projects.
- `:constant` syntactic pattern is now more general. Earlier you could only match a symbol in a scope. Now it accepts any form whatsoever.
- `:type` no longer binds the value being matched. **This is a breaking change.** Replace all occurrences of `(:type SomeType some-symbol)` in your code with `(:and (:type SomeType) some-symbol)`.

### Added
- `!look-in` pattern function, and a corresponding `:look-in` syntactic pattern.

# akar v1.0.0 / 2018.03.23
